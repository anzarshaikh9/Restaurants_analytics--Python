## Project Structure and Problem Statements
### Level 1: 
#### Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Explore the dataset and identify the number of rows and columns.
- Check for missing values in each column and handle them accordingly.
- Perform data type conversion if necessary. Analyze the distribution of the target variable ("Aggregate rating") and identify any class imbalances.

#### Task 2: Descriptive Analysis
- Calculate basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.
- Explore the distribution of categorical variables like "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines".
- Identify the top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.

#### Task 3: Geospatial Analysis
- Visualize the locations of restaurants on a map using latitude and longitude information.
- Analyze the distribution of restaurants across different cities or countries.
- Determine if there is any correlation between the restaurant's location and its rating.

### Level 2: 
#### Task 1: Table Booking and Online Delivery
- Determine the percentage of restaurants that offer table booking and online delivery.
- Compare the average ratings of restaurants with table booking and those without.
- Analyze the availability of online delivery among restaurants with different price ranges.

#### Task 2: Price Range Analysis
- Determine the most common price range among all the restaurants.
- Calculate the average rating for each price range.
- Identify the color that represents the highest average rating among different price ranges.

#### Task 3: Feature Engineering
- Extract additional features from the existing columns, such as the length of the restaurant name or address.
- Create new features like "Has Table Booking" or "Has Online Delivery" by encoding categorical variables.
